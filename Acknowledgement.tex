This is the part where you express your gratitude to all parties involved in the success of your thesis work. However, keep it simple and short. 
Example: I wish to thank the members of my committee for their support, patience and good humor. Their gentle but firm direction has been most appreciated. \ADVISOR was particularly helpful in guiding me toward a qualitative methodology. \COADVISOR interest in sense of competence was the impetus for my proposal. Finally, I would like to thank Dr. Stephen Fain. From the beginning, he had confidence in my abilities to not only complete a degree but to complete it with excellence.
I have found my coursework throughout the Curriculum and Instruction program to be stimulating and thoughtful, providing me with the tools with which to explore both past and present ideas and issues.
