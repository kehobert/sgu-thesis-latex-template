	\section{Problem Statement}
	\label{sec:problem-statement}
	In formulating a research problem, it is essential to identify a specific and well-defined issue within your field of study that warrants investigation. The research problem should be clear, concise, and compelling, posing a question or challenge that both contributes to the existing body of knowledge and has practical relevance. It should reflect a gap in current understanding, necessitating further exploration and analysis. A strong research problem serves as the foundation upon which your entire study is built, guiding the research process, and helping to define the scope and objectives of your research. To assist in defining research problems, a fishbone diagram is recommended.

	Note: when youâ€™re thinking about research problem and objective, please make sure your Feasibility, Realistic Timeline, Resource Availability, Data Availability, and Contingency Plan (Plan A, Plan B and Plan C with different scoping).

	\section{Research Objective}
	\label{sec:research-objective}	
	For Research Question and Objective, making sure they are specific and match the research problem. Ensure they can be measured and are feasible. Cover all aspects of the research objectives, problems, and gaps in a complete and coherent manner. Stay open to different approaches and maintain consistency throughout. Use clear and precise language while emphasizing the relevance and importance of your research. Keep in mind that each objective and question should be achievable within your research context. Overall, create a well-organized thesis that addresses each element of the assessment format effectively.
